* Please avoid reporting a problem that cannot be reproduced by project members.
  Instead, include enough information (typically, an example test or more,
  perhaps accompanied by a Maven/Ant/Gradle build script) so that other developers
  can verify the problem in their own environments.
  Otherwise, there is a good chance the issue will be immediately closed with the
  "could not reproduce" tag.
